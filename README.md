# eInk-Bindicator2

New version of Bindicator but this time it uses an ESP32 with an e-Ink display to display the next Bin (green or blue in my case), and the date that it's due to be picked up - handy for the Bank Holidays which affect the pickups.

Added code that puts the ESP32 into deep sleep mode and wakes up every 12 hours to update.

I printed a case from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4670205 and also used some of the code as inspiration - particularly drawing and deep sleep code.
